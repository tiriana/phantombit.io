### ðŸŒŸ What Sets Me Apart
I combine technical expertise with a modern, AI-augmented development approach, but I also understand that software is a tool to achieve business goals. While I love creating high-quality software, my priority is to ensure the work helps peopleâ€”making their tasks easier, faster, and more enjoyable. Developers are creating tools for others, not just abstract applications for personal amusement (though sometimes we do, as you can see in my npm packages: [crazy-case](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crazy-case), [git-jira-fast-ticket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-jira-fast-ticket)).
